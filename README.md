Temperature Converter Using JavaScript

This project is a Temperature Converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows the user to convert temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

The user enters a temperature value and specifies the unit (C or F). JavaScript is used to perform the conversion using standard formulas and display the result on the same page without reloading. The project uses DOM manipulation to read input values and update the output dynamically.

This project helps beginners understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements and how basic calculations are implemented in web applications.
